==================================================================================
			1. Installing Wii and Gamecube games
==================================================================================

To launch Wii games you must have D2X v8 or v10 installed with at least cIOS 249 base 57 and cIOS 250 base 56 installed (+ cIOS 251 base 58 for a very little amount of games). Many partition formats are supported.
To launch Gamecube games you must have Nintendont installed and your drive should be formatted to FAT32 (DML and Devolution are not supported).

Note that cIOS can be launched directly during WiiFlow startup to boot Wii games faster (base 57 recommended for better stability):
> Settings > Startup and shutdown > Boot Wiiflow using cIOS > On
Depending on the hard drive used, WiiFlow may hang on startup after enabling this option,
delete WiiFlow Wii save in that case to turn it off.

Choose the device where your games will be stored:
> Wii (or GameCube) settings > Manage Wii (or GameCube) game list > Wii (or GameCube) partition > SD or USB

Select your Wii / GameCube game directory (optional, default are dev:/wbfs for Wii and dev:/games for Gamecube):
> Wii (or GameCube) settings > Manage Wii (or GameCube) game list > Custom path
Note that you shouldn't change default directories if you plan to use other loaders to launch your games.

Dump your discs using:
> Wii (or GameCube) settings > Manage Wii (or GameCube) game list > Install game
Or put your already dumped WBFS / ISO folders and files in Wii (or Gamecube) games directory.

To organize your game coverflows, read "source_menu_readme.txt" to know more about source menu setup.

If you add games to your drive outside of Wiiflow, refresh coverflow list each time you add a new game:
> Wii (or GameCube) settings > Manage Wii (or GameCube) game list > Refresh coverflow list

NB: Gamecube games are dumped by default in 1:1 ISO files but Nintendont accepts compressed games (including CISO).


==================================================================================
			2. Installing Wii Channels and Virtual console games
==================================================================================

You first have to install an "emunand" on your drive, i.e. an "emulated" version of your Wii internal storage memory (e.g. NAND). Your drive must be formatted to FAT32.

Use Wiiflow's NAND extractor to create the emunand. This way all your Wii settings will be ported to your emunand: Wiimotes sync info, Wifi settings, your approval of Wiiconnect24 (EULA)... You can also use ModMii (PC software) to create a modded emunand.

Choose the device where your emunand will be extracted to:
> Wii channels settings > Manage Wii channel list > Emunands partition > SD or USB

Create a new emunand folder (optional):
> Wii channels settings > Manage Wii channel list > Create new emunand folder

Select your emunand folder:
> Wii channels settings > Manage Wii channel list > Channel emunand folder

Extract your NAND:
> Wii channels settings > Manage Wii channel list > Extract nand to emunand

Your NAND is now dumped on your drive, in dev:/(vwii)nands/[default], with all the Wii channels, forwarders and saves it contains.

To add games to it, you must have them packed in WAD files in a folder on your drive, then go to:
> Wii channels settings > Manage Wii channel list > Install Wii channel (Wad file) > (select wad file)

You can select one file only or a whole folder containing multiple wad files:
> Wii channels settings > Manage Wii channel list > Batch install folder > (select wad folder)

(NB : some games won't work, such as Konami "Rebirth" titles, some N64..., and you'll need to install neek2o to make them work, see below).

If you add games to your emunand outside of Wiiflow, you'll need to refresh coverflow list.


Partial / Full mode
-------------------

> Wii channels settings > Global nand emulation > Emunand mode > (Partial or Full)

In "Partial" mode, games will be launched using your real nand settings and Miis.
In "Full" mode, games will be launched using your emunand settings and Miis.
If you add new Miis to the emunand Mii channel in "Full" mode, you won't see them when returning to your real nand.

NB : games booting in one mode and not the other mean there's something wrong in the nand config:
If only "Partial" is working, your emunand is not well configured (try to extract your real nand with Wiiflow instead of building it with Modmii).
If only "Full" is working, your real Wii settings are not well configured (maybe you haven't approved Wiiconnect24 terms of use).


==================================================================================
			3. Installing emulator plugins
==================================================================================

Emulators must be installed on your drive. Some emulators have specific Wiiflow plugin versions, that can be stored in dev:/wiiflow/plugins.

Each plugin must have a [plugin name].ini file in dev:/wiiflow/plugins.
Read "plugins_readme.txt" to know more about plugins setup.

To see your games in coverflow, select "[plugin name]" in Plugin settings:
> Plugin settings > Select plugins > (choose plugin)
 
Or create a source menu entry for each source (source=plugin + magic=[magic#]).
Read "source_menu_readme.txt" to know more about source menu setup.

Refresh coverflow list each time a new game is added outside of Wiiflow:
> Plugin settings > Manage Plugin game list > Refresh coverflow list


==================================================================================
			4. Adding cover images and information to your games
==================================================================================

Downloading GameTDB database for Wii, Wii channels and Gamecube games
---------------------------------------------------------------------

> Wii (or Wii channels, or GameCube) settings > Download covers and info > GameTDB game info > Download


Adding covers to Wii, Wii channels and Gamecube games
-----------------------------------------------------

> Wii (or Wii channels, or GameCube) settings > Download covers and info > Current coverflow covers > Download


Adding disc labels to Wii and Gamecube games
--------------------------------------------

> Wii (or Wii channels, or GameCube) settings > Download covers and info > Current coverflow disc labels > Download

Full box cover PNG files are downloaded in dev:/wiiflow/boxcovers/
Front only box cover PNG files are downloaded in dev:/wiiflow/covers/
They'll be cached during the process in dev:/wiiflow/cache/


Downloading database for emulators
----------------------------------

On your PC, get Wiimpathy's plugin database. Read this thread:

https://gbatemp.net/threads/wiiflow-lite-with-emulators-database.527613/

Get database.

https://www.mediafire.com/file/4blrpsqqn5g0bdu/Wiiflow_Database.7z/file

Extract to dev:/wiiflow/plugins_data

Get packages of rom snapshots and cart/disk images.

http://www.mediafire.com/file/6a563zva8c7weew/Wiiflow_Snapshots.7z/file

Extract to dev:/wiiflow/snapshots

https://www.mediafire.com/file/xegmyb7uxid4nki/Wiiflow_CartDisk.7z/file

Extract to dev:/wiiflow/cart_disk


Adding covers to plugin games
-----------------------------

On your PC, get Tetsuo Shima cover collections for emulators:

https://gbatemp.net/threads/cover-collections-part-2.559649/

You can also take a look at the older collection from Mastershoes:

Create a folder for each plugin and put:

- full box cover PNG files in:
dev:/wiiflow/boxcovers/[folder name]/[rom name].png

- front only box cover PNG files in:
dev:/wiiflow/covers/[folder name]/[rom name].png

Update your dev:/wiiflow/plugins/[plugin name].ini files "coverfolder" field:
coverfolder=[folder name]

Once in Wiiflow, you may need to cache your new images by refreshing coverflow list:
> Plugin settings > Manage Plugin game list > Refresh coverflow list

Once cached, PNG files can be removed from your drive.


Adding covers to homebrew titles
-----------------------------

Put:

- full box cover PNG files in:
dev:/wiiflow/boxcovers/homebrew/[homebrew title].png

- front only box cover PNG files in:
dev:/wiiflow/covers/homebrew/[homebrew title].png

- small picture PNG files in:
dev:/wiiflow/covers/homebrew_small/[homebrew title].png
(this will replace the default icon taken from dev:/apps/[homebrew title]/icon.png)


Adding default cover to a platform
----------------------------------

Put full box default cover PNG files in:
dev:/wiiflow/boxcovers/blank_covers/[platform name].png
(Platform names are defined in dev:/wiiflow/plugins_data/platform.ini)


==================================================================================
			5. Settings for saves and DLC
==================================================================================

Wii games
---------

Wii game saves can be stored either on real nand or emunand. If you choose to use your real nand for saves, just leave:
> Wii settings > Global nand emulation > Wii disc emunand mode > Off

You can also choose to store your saves on emunand, and you can even select a dedicated emunand for them (then you have to create it prior to do this). Go to:
> Wii settings > Global nand emulation > Wii disc emunand partition > (select your "Wii disc emunand" device: SD or USB)
> Wii settings > Global nand emulation > Wii disc emunand folder (select the emunand where you want to store your saves)
> Wii settings > Global nand emulation > Wii disc emunand mode > Saves/DLC (or Full to use Miis from emunand)

The last option can be modified on a per-game basis, in game settings select:
> Nand emulation > Nand emulation > Saves/DLC (or Full to use Miis from emunand)

Your Wii game saves will now be stored on your drive, and you can also add DLC wad packages to this emunand.

NB: You can't launch Wii games with saves on emunand if both game and emunand are on SD card.

If you haven't built your emunand using Wiiflow, you may want to extract your existing saves from your real nand to your emunand, then go to:
> Wii settings > Global nand emulation > Extract all saves from nand

To extract the save for one particular game, go to game settings and select:
> Nand emulation > Extract nand save to emunand
You can also copy the save stored on your "saves emunand" back to the real nand on the same screen with:
> Nand emulation > Flash emunand save to nand


Wii Channels and Virtual console games
--------------------------------------

Wii Channels and Virtual console game saves are stored on the same emunand the games are launched from.


Gamecube games
--------------

Gamecube game saves are handled by Nintendont, but Wiiflow can pass some arguments to manage saves, options are as follow:

- Use a real GC memory card:
> GameCube settings > Global emulation settings > Virtual MemCard mode > Disabled

- Create a virtual 256-block memory card for each game (recommended):
> GameCube settings > Global emulation settings > Virtual MemCard mode > 256 blocks

- Create a virtual 1019-block memory card for each game (may be useful for some sports games but may be unstable):
> GameCube settings > Global emulation settings > Virtual MemCard mode > 1019 blocks

- Create only one virtual memory card for all saves:
> GameCube settings > Global emulation settings > Virtual MemCard mode > Multi saves

All options can be modified on a per-game basis, go to game settings and select:
> Manage virtual MemCard

Virtual memory cards are stored on the same device as Gamecube games in dev:/saves (this path cannot be modified).

You can copy those saves if you want a backup on another device, go to game settings and select:
> Manage virtual MemCard > Backup save file

Save backups are stored in dev:/wiiflow/backups, you can modify this path:
> Settings > Path manager > Game save backup path

You can also delete a virtual memory card (can be useful if the 256-block one was not enough and you want to recreate a 1019 blocks one), go to game settings and select:
> Manage virtual MemCard > Delete save file


Emulator plugins
----------------

Saves are handled by emulators and cannot be managed within Wiiflow.


==================================================================================
			6. Managing game categories
==================================================================================

A set of 20 default categories is created on the first Wiiflow boot if no former categories_lite.ini file is found.

You can choose to update those categories automatically using GameTDB and Wiimpathy's databases:
> Settings > User interface > Fetch categories from GameTDB > On

Categories will automatically be assigned to existing and new games, including region tags (NTSC-U, NTSC-J, PAL).

If a new category is found in GameTDB, it will be added to the list. New categories from Wiimpathy's base won't be added.

To manually add a new category, go to:
> Settings > Misc settings > Add new category


==================================================================================
			7. Using cheat codes
==================================================================================

Wii, Wii Channels, Virtual console and Gamecube games can be launched with Gecko cheat codes.

To download, then activate one or more codes, go to game settings and select:
> Cheat codes > Cheat codes

To deactivate all codes, go to game settings and select:
> Cheat codes > Enable ocarina (cheats) > Off

You can also find full packs of txt cheat codes on internet and put them in dev:/wiiflow/codes/.


==================================================================================
			8. Adding user items to theme
==================================================================================

Theme can be modified by editing dev:/wiiflow/themes_lite/[theme].ini

Up to 4 image layers can be added to these menus:

- Setting screens using [CONFIG/USER1] to [CONFIG/USER4]
- Main coverflow screen using [MAIN/USER1] to [MAIN/USER4]
- Game screen using [GAME/USER1] to [GAME/USER4]
- Game info screen using [GAMEINFO/USER1] to [GAMEINFO/USER4]
- Source menu screen using [SOURCE/USER1] to [SOURCE/USER4]
- Parental lock code screen using [CODE/USER1] to [CODE/USER4]
- Game controller guide using [GAMEGUIDE/USER1] to [GAMEGUIDE/USER4]
- File explorer using [EXPLORER/USER1] to [EXPLORER/USER4]
- Help / Credits screen using [ABOUT/USER1] to [ABOUT/USER4]
- Coverflow adjust screen using [CFTHEME/USER1] to [CFTHEME/USER4]
- Keyboard screen using [KEYBOARD/USER1] to [KEYBOARD/USER4]
- Home menu using [HOME/USER1] to [HOME/USER4]
- Exit to screen using [EXIT_TO/USER1] to [EXIT_TO/USER4]

Sourceflow attributes can be forced in [theme].ini file:

[_SOURCEFLOW]
box_mode=yes/no
enabled=yes/no
smallbox=yes/no


==================================================================================
			9. Launching Wii Channels in neek2o mode
==================================================================================

Why should I do that?
---------------------

The only benefit of neek2o mode is to be able to play WiiWare and Virtual console games that only play using neek2o (Konami "Rebirth" titles, some N64 and neo-geo VC...).


How do I do that?
-----------------

First you must make sure you have installed your emunand properly on your SD or USB drive. It must be installed on the first primary partition of the drive, formatted to FAT32. You can have a maximum of 7 emunands for neek2o to launch properly.

Then you must install neek2o. The easiest way is to use ModMii on your PC that provides compiled kernels for neek2o (there are different kernels for SD and USB).

You should have a "sneek" folder on your drive containing:

sneek/kernel.bin
sneek/font.bin
sneek/di.bin (if you choose to have Disc Interface to launch Wii games through System Menu in neek2o mode)

(NB: DI will not work if you have tons of Wii games ripped on your drive, and System Menu in neek2o mode will fail to launch).

It is also recommended to install neek2o "Back to nand" forwarder channel on your emunand, this way Wiiflow will use it to go back to real NAND when you quit the game. You can install it using:
> Wii channels settings > Manage Wii channel list > Install Wii channel (Wad file)

Once it's done, launch your Virtual console game from emunand coverflow with neek2o ON in game settings:
> Nand emulation > Nand emulation > Neek2o


==================================================================================
			10. Starting Wiiflow in neek2o mode
==================================================================================

(NOT AVAILABLE ON WIIU)


Why should I do that?
----------------------

The only benefit of starting Wiiflow in neek2o mode is to be able to play Virtual console games that only play using neek2o (Castlevania Rebirth, some N64...), with CHEAT CODES activated.


How do I do that?
------------------

First you must make sure you have a working neek2o setup on your USB drive (Wiiflow in neek2o mode won't work on SD). That means you should have your emunand folder and sneek kernel on USB.
Your emunand must have Wiiflow forwarder channel installed, you can install it using:
> Wii channels settings > Manage Wii channel list > Install Wii channel (Wad file)

Then launch Wiiflow in neek2o mode:
> Wii channels settings > Global nand emulation > Neek2o Wiiflow channel

Always make sure you have selected the right "emunands partition" and "channel emunand" in:
> Wii channels settings > Manage Wii channel list > Emunands partition > USB
> Wii channels settings > Manage Wii channel list > Channel emunand folder > [you name it]

Once in neek2o mode, remember your USB drive is now seen as your "real" NAND, so any feature that involves real NAND will now affect the USB drive.
Consequently, most of the features are disabled, such as settings and the ability to launch non channel games.


How to go back to real NAND mode?
----------------------------------

> Home menu > Restart Wii


==================================================================================
			11. Launching Wii System Menu in neek2o mode
==================================================================================

Why should I do that?
---------------------

You shouldn't. Except if you want to tamper with System Menu themes or create your own forwarders and test them on your emunands without bricking your Wii.
WiiU version of neek2o is buggy and doesn't display channels in System Menu.


How do I do that?
-----------------

You must have a working neek2o setup and one or several emunands installed on your drive (e.g. one or several folders in dev:/nands/).

Choose your emunand in:
> Wii channels settings > Manage Wii channel list > Emunands partition > [your drive]
> Wii channels settings > Manage Wii channel list > Channel emunand folder > [you name it]

Then launch System Menu:

> Wii channels settings > Global nand emulation > Neek2o system menu

Make sure you have neek2o "Back to nand" forwarder channel installed on your emunand, to be able to go back to real NAND without powering off.


==================================================================================
			12. Game compatibility issues
==================================================================================

Not 100% of Wii / WiiWare games will launch with default settings, sometimes you'll have to tweak game settings to make them work.


WiiWare / Virtual console games
-------------------------------

Wii channels issues can be easily solved by installing and using neek2o mode (see "Launching Wii channels games in neek2o mode").


Wii games
---------

If a Wii game doesn't boot, first try to disable all patches and make sure "Language" is set to "Console" in game settings:
> Language > Console
(That could be useful for games like Kirby's adventures, which won't work otherwise.)

You can also try to force another cIOS base (56/57/58) in game settings:
> Compatibility > cIOS > (choose the slot where you installed the cIOS base)

If it still doesn't work, try to patch your real nand region temporarily in game settings:
> Compatibility > Adapt Wii region to game > On
(That could be useful for some trivia Ubisoft NTSC games that won't work on PAL consoles otherwise.)

For some Wii games with strong anti-piracy protection, you'll have no option but to launch them from neek2o menu with DI (Disc Interface):
(Adventures of Tintin, Driver San Francisco...)
You can redirect those games directly to neek2o system menu in game settings:
> Nand emulation > Nand emulation > Neek2o

Note that it will launch your "Wii disc emunand" and not your "channel emunand".


==================================================================================
			13. Adding custom video trailers
==================================================================================

You can add a video trailer to any game by creating a THP video file using Wiiflow THP Video Converter, you can download it here:
http://www.mediafire.com/file/talv6gm1al0l7mb/WiiflowTHPVideoConverter.rar/file

Note that you'll have to make a separate THP file for video and an OGG file for sound.

You'll also find a set of premade trailers shared by Danimalzpwn3 on this thread:
https://gbatemp.net/threads/wiiflow-lite-game-trailers-database.552587/


Wii games, Wii channels and Gamecube games
------------------------------------------

Rename the *.thp and *.ogg files to the game ID or first 3 digits of the game ID (ID3.thp) and place the files into 
dev:/wiiflow/trailers


Plugin games
------------

Rename the *.thp and *.ogg files to the rom name with extension (rom_name.ext.thp) and place the files into 
dev:/wiiflow/trailers/[coverfolder]
where "coverfolder" is the same subfolder name used by the plugin for covers.


You can also create a video that will be used for any game of a plugin
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rename the *.thp and *.ogg files to the magic number of the plugin (1234ABCD.thp) and place the files into 
dev:/wiiflow/trailers


Click the video icon after selecting a game in coverflow to launch the video trailer.


==================================================================================
			14. Adding custom game sounds
==================================================================================

You can add a banner game sound to any plugin game by creating an OGG sound file.

Rename the *.ogg file to the rom name with extension (rom_name.ext.ogg) and place the file into 
dev:/wiiflow/gamesounds/[coverfolder]
where "coverfolder" is the same subfolder name used by the plugin for covers.


==================================================================================
			15. Adding custom banners
==================================================================================

You can add a banner to any plugin game by creating a BNR file.
You'll find more information about how to do this here:
https://sites.google.com/site/wiibannerguide/

Rename the *.bnr file to the rom name with extension (rom_name.ext.bnr) and place the file into 
dev:/wiiflow/custom_banners/[coverfolder]
where "coverfolder" is the same subfolder name used by the plugin for covers.


==================================================================================
			16. Adding fanart backgrounds and animations
==================================================================================

You can add a fanart custom background with animation to any game. You'll find more information about how to do this here:
https://sites.google.com/site/wiiflowiki4/wiiflow-fanart

You'll also find a set of premade fanart themes shared by fledge68 here:
http://www.mediafire.com/?bmqi2md844ayc

Place the fanart folder for each game into 
dev:/wiiflow/fanart

For plugin games place them into
dev:/wiiflow/fanart/[coverfolder]
where "coverfolder" is the same subfolder name used by the plugin for covers.

Background will appear shortly after a game has been selected.
Animation acts as a screensaver and will appear a few seconds after a game has been selected, if no input is detected.


==================================================================================
